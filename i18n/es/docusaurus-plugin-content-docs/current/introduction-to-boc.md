# Introduction to BOC

## What is BOC

BOC (Bank Of Chain) is a new and innovative way to interact with decentralized financial ([DeFi](appendix#decentralized-finance-defi)) [protocols](appendix#protocol). It helps ordinary investors to obtain a "free-risk" capital-guaranteed wealth management tool on [blockchain](appendix#blockchain-network).

The BOC platform connects carefully selected protocols within the crypto ecosystem, including [Automatic Market Makers (AMMs)](appendix#automated-market-maker-amm), [lending protocols](appendix#lending-protocol), [yield aggregators](appendix#yield-aggregators), etc. (see <https://dashboard.bankofchain.io/#/> for details). 

By accessing high-quality [protocol](appendix#protocol) [strategies](appendix#strategy), BOC can be 300-500 basis points (3-5%) higher than other similar USD managed funds. 

For newcomers to the crypto industry, this is the best way to enter the DeFi ecosystem. As a one-click protocol BOC will bring a new revolution to the DeFi industry, attracting hundreds of millions of dollars of investment.

## BOC Source of Yield

BOC is a DeFi protocol that provides the best long-term "free-risk" return, and it’s source of Yield includes:

- The transaction fee charged for providing market-making funds for decentralized exchange (DEX). 

- The interest charged on funds borrowed for over-collateralized lending.

- Governance token rewards.

## Fund Allocation Rules

- Priority is on the higher yield [capital pools](appendix#liquidity-pool-or-capital-pool).
- The investment capital of a single capital pool cannot exceed 20% of the total investment assets.
- The funds of a single capital pool cannot exceed 50% of its existing lock-up amount.
- Multiple capital pools in the same agreement cannot exceed 30% of the total investment assets.
- There is a regular automatic evaluation for profit review. With the goal of optimize the allocation of funds when the profit from position adjustment is greater than the cost.

## Why BOC existence

The existing DeFi protocols have the following problems:

- There are cases of several [impermanent losses](appendix#impermanent-loss) in decentralized exchanges from market making. In 2021, UniswapV3’s market-making revenue is only about $200 million, but [those pools have suffered impermanent losses of $260 million](https://cointelegraph.com/news/half-of-uniswap-v3-liquidity-providers-are-losing-money-new-research), resulting in a total net loss of $60 million. 
- Is usual that revenue aggregators suffer from circular dependencies.
- Many agreements have high investment thresholds. 
- In general DeFi protocols have multiple pools, and users need a relatively higher level of knowledge to choose which underlying protocols to invest in. At the same time, many of them products need to invest in a variety of different currencies, and users need to convert them into the currency required by the product.
- The investment process is complicated. In the process of investment rebalancing, users need to implement complex operations such as withdrawal, currency exchange and investment.

## What makes BOC Different

BOC is an open platform that realizes decentralized investment by doing a mix of carefully selected DeFi protocols, creating long-term stable income avoiding most risks.

The main characteristic that make BOC a unique product are:

User-friendliness:

1. Users shall deposit and withdraw directly without thinking to implement and bear the cost of complex operations such as farming, exchange, and reallocation. BOC makes the best selection for them.
2. Profits are automatically reinvested with an immediate deposit and withdrawal process.
3. Historical and dynamic returns are intuitively visible.

Safety:

1. The market cap of qualified stablecoins exceeds 1 billion dollars.
2. The TVL of qualified Blockchains exceeds 5 billion dollars.
3. It has third party auditing in place.
4. BOC does not use unofficial third-party cross-chain bridges for transactions.
5. The price quotation relies on Chainlink, a market-leading oracle.

Risk control:

1. It minimizes the de-anchoring risk of stablecoins.
2. It plays down the risk of impermanent loss, BOC use market-making for [stablecoin](appendix#stablecoin) pairs only.
3. The systemic risk is optimized by the very selective wrapped [tokens](appendix#token) and yield aggregators.
4. The long-tail risk is really low, any yield are generated from risk servicing business, such as insurance underwriting, sell call options.
5. There is no risk in leveraging, any leverage function is provided.

Smart algorithm:

1. Yields are regularly calibrated, weighing the cost and reward for funds reallocation.
2. It makes continues searches for the best rate through exchange aggregators.
3. BOC performs FX interest swap, adjusting FX synthesis based on exchange rate and yield.
4. Parameters are automatically set for market-making and lending strategy.

In summary, BOC Platform is the missing catalyst that will revolutionize the industry generating a new way to interact with the DeFi Ecosystem, making it a safe path for newcomers. This will lead to a new market growth compared to other similar products in the market:
