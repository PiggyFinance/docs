# Introduction to BOC

## What is BOC

BOC (Bank Of Chain) is a new and innovative way to interact with decentralized financial ([DeFi](appendix#decentralized-finance-defi)) [protocols](appendix#protocol). It helps ordinary investors to obtain a "risk-free" capital-guaranteed wealth management tool on the [blockchain](appendix#blockchain-network).

The BOC platform connects carefully selected protocols within the crypto ecosystem, including [Automatic Market Makers (AMMs)](appendix#automated-market-maker-amm), [lending protocols](appendix#lending-protocol), [yield aggregators](appendix#yield-aggregators), etc. (see <https://dashboard.bankofchain.io/#/> for details). 

By accessing high-quality [protocol](appendix#protocol) [strategies](appendix#strategy), BOC can provide for 300-500 basis points (3-5%) above other similar USD managed funds. 

For newcomers to the crypto industry, this is the best way to enter the DeFi ecosystem. As a one-click protocol BOC will bring a new revolution to the DeFi industry, attracting hundreds of millions of dollars of investment.

## BOC Source of Yield

BOC is a DeFi protocol that provides the best long-term "risk-free" return. It’s source of return includes:

- The transaction fee charged for providing market-making funds to decentralized exchanges (DEX). 

- The interest charged on funds borrowed for over-collateralized loans.

- Governance token rewards.

## Fund Allocation Rules

- Priority is allocated to [capital pools](appendix#liquidity-pool-or-capital-pool) that provide the higher yield.
- The capital invested in a single capital pool cannot exceed 20% of the total assets under management.
- The capital allocated to a single capital pool cannot exceed 50% of their existing lock-up amount.
- Multiple capital pools in the same protocol cannot exceed 30% of the total assets under management.
- Funds allocation is adjusted automatically to ensure the most cost-efficient position.

The existing DeFi protocols present the following problems:

- [Impermanent losses](appendix#impermanent-loss) in decentralized exchanges from market makers. In 2021, UniswapV3’s market-making revenue was about $200 million, but [those pools have suffered impermanent losses of $260 million](https://cointelegraph.com/news/half-of-uniswap-v3-liquidity-providers-are-losing-money-new-research), resulting in a total net loss of $60 million. 
- Circular dependencies for revenue aggregators.
- High investment thresholds. 
- Operating requires a high degree of sophistication from users and presents a complex user interface.
- Require multiple different currencies


## What makes BOC Different

BOC is an open platform performs decentralized investing by carefully running selected DeFi protocols to create long-term stable income avoiding risk.

The main characteristics that make BOC a unique product are:

User-friendliness:

1. Users can deposit and withdraw directly without considering the difficulties of implementing complex operations such as farming, exchange, and reallocation. BOC makes the best selection for them.
2. Profits are automatically reinvested with an immediate deposit and withdrawal process.
3. Historical and dynamic returns are intuitively visible.

Safety:

1. The market cap of qualified stablecoins exceeds 1 billion dollars.
2. The TVL of qualified Blockchains exceeds 5 billion dollars.
3. It has third party auditing in place.
4. BOC does not use unofficial third-party cross-chain bridges for transactions.
5. The price quotation relies on Chainlink, a market-leading oracle.

Risk control:

1. It minimizes the de-anchoring risk of stablecoins.
2. It plays down the risk of impermanent loss, BOC use market-making for [stablecoin](appendix#stablecoin) pairs only.
3. The systemic risk is optimized by the very selective wrapped [tokens](appendix#token) and yield aggregators.
4. The long-tail risk is really low, any yield are generated from risk servicing business, such as insurance underwriting, sell call options.
5. There is no risk in leveraging, any leverage function is provided.

Smart algorithm:

1. Yields are regularly calibrated, weighing the cost and reward for funds reallocation.
2. It makes continues searches for the best rate through exchange aggregators.
3. BOC performs FX interest swap, adjusting FX synthesis based on exchange rate and yield.
4. Parameters are automatically set for market-making and lending strategy.
