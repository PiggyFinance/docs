# Governance

BOC is a disruptive blockchain innovation that aims to change the DeFi ecosystem. It will serve as a bridge between fund lenders and investment operators. BOC will be a gate to newcomers on the crypto investing world, creating a new way to interact with the DeFi Ecosystem.

## DAO Development

By the moment, the governance of BOC is through Gnosis multi-signature. In the future, governance will be assumed by the DAO. 

The DAO will use [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/) for off-chain voting and the execution proposals by on-chain smart contracts. 

The Governance tokens are yet to be developed but will be launched soon.

## Tokenomics

The maximum supply of BOC tokens is 1 billion. Tokenholders will receive a BOC management fee according to the holding ratio. After the tokens are locked, they can participate in governance and share the benefits. The specific tokens are planned to be distributed in the following 4 parts: team, investors, community and reserved part.

## Audit

All BOC smart contracts are audited by independent labs as SlowMist among others.

## Bug Bounty Program

By collaborating with third parties, BOC will establish a way in which the community will help to improve the quality of the smart contracts used. Potential third-party organisations includes the premier bug bounty platform and the DeFi Project. In those organizations, security researchers review code, disclose vulnerabilities, have the incentive to help to make smart contracts more secure.
