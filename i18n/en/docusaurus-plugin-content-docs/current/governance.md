# Governance

BOC is a disruptive blockchain innovation that aims to change the DeFi ecosystem. It will serve as a bridge between fund lenders and investment operators. BOC will be a gate to newcomers on the crypto investing world, creating a new way to interact with the DeFi Ecosystem.

## DAO Development

By the moment, the objective of BOC is to achieve co-management of the tokenholders through Gnosis multi-signature. In the future, governance rights will be transferred to DAO. 

The DAO program will:

* Execute proposals by on-chain smart contracts.
* Use snapshots for off-chain voting
<!-- TODO ASK-->
* Finish the development of Governance tokens.

## Tokenomics

The maximum supply of BOC tokens is 1 billion. Tokenholders will receive a BOC management fee according to the holding ratio. After the tokens are locked, they can participate in governance and share the benefits. The specific tokens are planned to be distributed in the following 4 parts: team, investors, community and reserved part.

## Audit

All BOC smart contracts are audited by independent labs as SlowMist among others.

## Bug Bounty Program

By collaborating with third parties, BOC will establish a way in which the community will help to improve the quality of the smart contracts used. Potential third-party organisations includes the premier bug bounty platform and the DeFi Project. In those organizations, security researchers review code, disclose vulnerabilities, have the incentive to help to make smart contracts more secure.
