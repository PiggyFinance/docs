# User Handbook

Here is a quick guide to interact and invest with the BOC platform.
First, to complete the investment in BOC we need to start on the user investment page. We go to the [home page](https://bankofchain.io/#/) and click on `LAUNCH APP` button.

## Wallet Connection

We can interact with BOC through [wallets](appendix#wallet), the APP is compatible [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/), by clicking on the `CONNECT WALLET` button.

After connecting the wallet, we can see the USDT balance in our account.

### Switch Chain

At the present, BOC works on Ethereum, BNB Chain and Polygon. If we need to switch chains, they can do it through `NETWORKS`.

## Investment and Redemption

### 

### Deposit

 Once the wallet has been successfully connected, we can complete the deposit by choosing the vault we what to use, on the `USDi Vault` we will have the stablecoin to use and selecting the desired amount and then clicking on `DEPOSIT`.

![pic7](/images/pic-7.png)

On the `ETHi Vault` we will have the possibility of investing ETH by selecting the desired amount and then clicking on `DEPOSIT`.

The `ETHi Vault` differently to the `USDi Vault` has a gas fee estimation.

### Withdrawal

After successfully connecting the wallet, we can complete the withdrawal by selecting vault we what to do use, on the `USDi Vault` is the possibility to withdraw a single stablecoin or mix we complete with the desired USDi and clicking `WITHDRAW`.

![pic8](/images/pic-8.png)

On the `ETHi Vault` there is the possibility to withdraw only ETH we complete with the desired ETHi and clicking `WITHDRAW`.

**Exchanged**: Exchange function enablement. Each strategy in the BOC uses different stablecoins. When we withdraw money, we will do it according to the strategy APY from low to high. If a non-USDT strategy is obtained, the stable currency of the corresponding strategy will be returned, e.g. if Yearn LUSD is obtained, LUSD will be returned and if the exchange is closed, the corresponding value of LUSD will be returned to our account. If redemption is enabled, the Slippage parameter needs to be set.

### Withdrawal Advanced Parameters

![advancesetting](/images/advancesetting.png)

The advanced setup parameters are:

**Max Loss**: The maximum loss on withdrawals. When we specify the amount of USDi to withdrawal, the total assets at the current net value will be displayed, but these are not the funds we can finally get, and losses may occur during the withdrawal process, including exchange slippage losses. If our total assets are estimated to be $1000 at this time, and we choose Max Loss=0.3%, then we will get no less than $997.

**Slippage**: [Slippage](appendix#slippage) between different currencies. After enabling Exchanged, we need to specify the slippage that we accept.

### Adding USDi and ETHi to your wallet

If the USDi is not shown on your wallet, you need to add it manually, we make it really easy you just to click on the `+` next to your USDi balance and press `Add Token`. Then you will see you USDi balance on your metamask wallet.

```

Analogously, ETHi can be added to the wallet in the same way.
