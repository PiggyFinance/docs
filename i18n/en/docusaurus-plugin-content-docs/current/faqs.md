# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## Blockchain FAQs

### What is blockchain?

Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. It encrypted blocks of data then chains them together to form a chronological single-source-of-truth for the data. Blockchain’s inherent security measures and public ledger make it a prime technology for almost every single sector.

### What problem blockchain solves?

Digital assets are easily copied and redistributed. On music and film industry it's a big problem, anyone can copy songs and movies and distribute them. Blockchain technology provides a database where is register every movement, and it can be distinguished when something is original or not. This is fits perfect with digital currency. We can distinguish one token (like a USDT) from another, assets can now be managed on a decentralized way.

### What is the difference between cryptocurrency and blockchain?

Blockchain makes cryptos possible. It's what manage cryptocurrency. There is several blockchains networks, to use them is usual that you have to pay a gas fee, for this you need to pay on the native cryptocurrency. If you use the Polygon blockchain you need Matic to pay the fee. This fee is the incentive to people to participate on the process and contribute to the safety of the blockchain network.

## DeFi FAQs

### What are Decentralized Finances? 

Decentralized finance (commonly known as DeFi) is a kind of real world finance but is created on the blockchain. It uses smart contracts on the blockchain (such as Ethereum) for financial activities. DeFi platforms allow people to lend or borrow funds to others, trade cryptocurrencies, and earn interest in savings-like accounts, all this without a centralized institution.

### Why BOC is secure?

BOC ensure it's safety being audited regularly as well as the integrated DeFi protocols. At the same time, BOC does not use unofficial third-party cross-chain bridges for transactions and the price quotation always relies on [Chainlink](https://chain.link/), a market-leading oracle.

### What stablecoins can I deposit and withdraw?

BOC currently provides users to deposit and withdraw USDT, USDC and DAI in any combination and in any amount. When depositing stablecoins, USDi of equivalent value will be minted as a collateral, which will be burned when users want to withdraw their stablecoins. 

### What is USDi? Can I use it to reinvest or do anything?

USDi is a collateral minted by users when they deposit stablecoins. The returns that users obtain via BOC protocol will be reflected in the increased amount of USDi in their wallet. USDi is pegged 1:1 as USD, in other word, it shows the user’s net USD value in BOC protocol. USDi is only a collateral which will be burned when withdrawing, it cannot be used for other financial activities.

### When will the BOC token be issued? 

It will be issued in June 2022.

### How soon will my balance increase once I have USDi?

The amount of USDi in your wallet will grow each time there is a positive rebase event. You can read more about this in [Rebase](protocol-algorithm-design#rebase). The supply is currently rebased once a day and is usually correlated with how many people are minting and burning USDi.

### What are the costs to mint and redeem USDi and ETHi?

As with any Ethereum transaction, you will need Ether to interact with the BOC smart contract. We have taken measures to reduce gas usage where possible, but these costs can vary.

For ETHi: Anytime you mint or burn ETHi, there will be an exchange rate applied to your stablecoins deposited or withdrawn. The depositing charge depends on [Oracles](appendix#oracle) and the withdrawing charge will be xx% to encourage long-term holding of ETHi and to protect the protocol from attackers.

For USDi: The depositing charge depends on Oracles and no withdrawing charge.
